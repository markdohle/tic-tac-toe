MIT xPro Week 16 - React Parent and Child Components

In Module 16: Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, youâ€™ll manage state across parent and child components. You'll also work through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

You'll apply these concepts in the creation of another game (of your choosing) in React, which you can share with your peers in the Parent And Child Components In A Game discussion. You will also have an opportunity to share your improvements to the Tic-Tac-Toe game with your peers at the end of the module. Be sure to contribute your code to a GitHub repository as you code along with the videos.

# Roadmap of Future Implement Improvements

1. Input box to place players names. Then direct the DOM to tell the user who's turn it is.

2. A check for errors. If a square has been selected, then the onClick event should not fire. If there is a winner, then the Square onClick should not fire.

3. AutoRestart when a winner or draw is decided.

4. A score card that keeps track of the score between two players.
